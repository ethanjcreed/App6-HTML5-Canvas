// This part of the code will put in a time that logs the last time modified to help see how long it takes for teh app to upload to the page. 
var docMod = document.lastModified; // loads last modified time stamp into docMod variable
alert("This file last modified " + docMod); // generates alert box with time stamp. If annoying, comment out this entire line.
console.log("This file last modified " + docMod); // generates message in javaScript console (found in developers tools) with time stamp. 

// the below code is a call of the canvas element and then asking the computer to draw a diagonal line
var c = document.getElementById("myCanvas");
var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
ctx.moveTo(0, 0);
ctx.lineTo(200, 100);
